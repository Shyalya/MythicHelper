Created an addon for MafWoW to specify your “main” character that has the highest ranks of your Mythic auras, which can then be easily distributed via the buttons, furthermore a Mythic Heroism Rota that rotates through all your raid and party
 members. a timer for the current runtime and a Mythic Endless Assault Potion button, all members get the request to use it, the reset takes place after leaving the fight.

I also added a no loot, no rest, don't avoid AoE button for the bots and a flask button for the Flask of the North.

Have fun testing
